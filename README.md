# Weather App - Project Overview

The Weather App is a personal project aimed at gaining practical experience in building applications that integrate external APIs and create a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. This application allows users to retrieve real-time weather information for a specific location by making requests to a weather API.

## Features

- **Weather Data**: Retrieve current weather data, including temperature, condition, and humidity, for any city or location.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application features an intuitive and user-friendly GUI built using Tkinter, making it accessible for users of all levels.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to provide informative feedback to users in case of invalid city names or failed API requests.
- **Modular Design**: The project follows a modular design pattern, separating the UI components from the main application logic for improved maintainability and scalability.

## System Requirements

- **Python**: The project is written in Python, so you need to have Python installed on your system.
 You can download Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **API Key**: To run the Weather App, you'll need to obtain an API key from a weather data provider.
  You can obtain a free API key from providers like OpenWeatherMap.

- **External Libraries**: The project uses the following external libraries, which can be installed using pip:
  - requests
  - tkinter (usually included with Python)

# How to Run the Weather App
